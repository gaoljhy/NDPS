The agreement draws on the debate rules, thesis elements, and simplifies to a general Internet specification

### The specifications are as follows

1. When giving a speech, it is necessary to briefly summarize the points to be expressed at the beginning
2. The need to express and reasonably explain the point of view, it is best to be able to describe their own practices
3. The facts stated must be accompanied by specific network basis, including but not limited to links
4. Indicate the agreement reference

### Sample

```

I don't agree with <NDPS>

Because this protocol has almost no role in my perception, it is too rigorous compared to other open source protocols such as <MIT>, so I object, but I also agree that there are too many arguments on the Internet that are meaningless and have no rules. So I decided to participate and contribute to my strength.
